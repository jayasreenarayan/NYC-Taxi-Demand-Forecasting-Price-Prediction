Project Proposal: Price Prediction for NYC Taxi Rides Using Trip Data 

1. The Problem

Accurately predicting taxi fares is essential for drivers, passengers, and operators to optimize pricing and improve transparency. In New York City, taxi fares depend on factors like distance, time of day, and duration. This project aims to build a predictive model for NYC taxi fares using historical trip data from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). By analyzing ride characteristics and applying regression and time-series analysis, we can provide insights into fare determination and seasonal trends.

3. Data Collection

We will use publicly available NYC Yellow Taxi trip data, including:

•	Trip Distance: A key determinant of fare.

•	Pickup/Dropoff Datetime: Used to extract features like trip duration, time of day, and day of the week.

•	Location IDs: Pickup and drop-off zones to capture geographic pricing variations.

•	Fare Amount: The target variable for prediction.

•	Additional Charges: Extras like tolls and surcharges to refine the model.

This dataset enables us to analyze how trip attributes influence fares without requiring external data.

3. Analytical Techniques
   
•	Descriptive Analysis:
o	Explore relationships between fare amounts and trip characteristics using summary statistics and visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts).

o	Identify how fares vary with trip distance, time of day, and geographic zones.

•	Regression Analysis:
o	Develop a multiple linear regression model using predictors like distance, time of day, and trip duration.

o	Evaluate performance metrics to measure prediction accuracy.

5. Impact and Goal
   
A successful model will predict taxi fares based on trip details before a ride starts, providing greater transparency to customers and helping taxi operators adjust pricing strategies. Insights from this project can guide city planners and improve user satisfaction through accurate fare estimates.
